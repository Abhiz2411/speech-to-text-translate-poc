Gurudev, memories also get deleted in this way with these three spiritual practices. Yes, it seems so.
That the mind, the mind's supply, is for the present moment, and this is the memory of the past. As we slow down the mind, the mind's connection with the present moment and with memory, that also slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly slows down. That also gets disconnected. And then you don't even remember it, and then that memory slowly gets lost. Bad memories. Good memories are necessary, but it's also necessary for bad memories to be lost. Gurudev, though there are fewer bad memories than good memories, they still come to mind. Yes, yes. Because bad memories are deep. And good memories are superficial. What is deep keeps coming out again and again. So what should we do? Whatever caused the bad memories, make that same thing the reason for good memories.

For a certain person, for a certain individual, there was a lot of suffering. With his nature, with his behavior, there was a lot of suffering. He came to a Guru like me. And he asked, "Gurudev, when I see him, I get very negative feelings; seeing him fills me with a lot of hatred. What should I do?" The Guru closed his eyes, the Guru opened his eyes and said, "He will die in six months." He thought, "Oh, he's going to die in six months?" He heard that and left. Now whenever he got angry at him, he would think, "Oh, that poor fellow is going to die in six months. Let it be, if it's good for him, it's good." "He's going to die in six months," this kept running in his mind again and again and again and again.

Now he started feeling goodwill towards him. Feelings for him started to emerge within him. What happened? When the six months were about to complete, what happened then? (Someone: Attention) When the six months were about to complete, such goodwill had developed for him that he would care for him, go to him, give him whatever he needed, repeatedly (thinking) 'now he will die, now he will die, now he will die.' When there were just two or three days left of the six months, he thought, "No, let's go to Gurudev once." He came back to the Guru. "Gurudev, you said that man will die when six months are complete, it's just two or three days away. Do something!" "What? He didn't die. That's good. What is that? That's good." The Guru said, "Where did I say that?" The Guru said, "Where did I say who would die? I only said, 'Di-di-what did I say? Will die.' Where did I say *he* will die?" Hello! The hatred inside you will die, the negativity inside you will die. I said that. It happened, didn't it? Oh Gurudev, I thought you were... So remember this, understanding a Guru is a bit... a bit tough, a bit different, a bit something... They say one thing, but mean something entirely different. Whenever a Guru says something to you, understand that what they are saying is not it; they are saying something else entirely. But we, what do we do? We catch the words. What the Guru means is something different. But what happened in the end, didn't it die? What died? The negativity, hatred, ill-will inside him died, didn't it? That's it. Thank you so much, Gurudev. Yes.
