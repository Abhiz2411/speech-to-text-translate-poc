Gurudev, will memory also be deleted in this way with these three spiritual practices?

Yes. It seems to me that the mind... the supply to the mind, you know, comes from the external triggers in front of us and the memories of the past.

As we slow down the mind, its connectivity with those triggers and with memory also gradually slows down. It also gets disconnected. And then, you don't even recall it, and that memory is gradually lost.

Bad memories. Good memories are necessary, but it is also necessary for bad memories to be lost.

Gurudev, compared to good memories, bad memories are far fewer, yet they are the ones we remember.

Yes. Yes. Because bad memories are deep, while good memories are on the surface. What is deep keeps surfacing again and again. So, what should we do?

The very person who is the cause of your bad memories, turn them into the reason for your good memories.

There was a person who had a great deal of trouble with someone. He had a lot of trouble with that person's nature and behavior. He came to a guru, like myself. And he asked, "Gurudev, just looking at that person gives me very negative feelings; I feel a lot of animosity towards him. What should I do?"

The Guru closed his eyes, then opened them and said, "He will die in six months."

He thought, "Oh, he's going to die in six months." Hearing this, he went away.

Now, whenever he would get angry, he would think, "Oh, that poor man is going to die in six months. Let it go. It would be good if something good happens to him." "He's going to die in six months"—this thought kept running through his mind over and over again.

Now, he began to feel goodwill towards that person. Positive feelings for him started to grow within.

What happened? When the six months were about to be over, what happened then?

When the six months were about to end, he had developed so much goodwill for the person that he would care for him, visit him, and give him whatever he needed. He kept thinking, "He's going to die soon." Now, with only two or three days left in the six-month period, he thought, "No, I must go to the Gurudev one more time."

He returned to the Guru.

"Gurudev, you said that man would die. There are only two or three days left for the six months to be complete. Please do something so that he doesn't die. He is a good person. He is a good person."

The Guru said, "When did I say that?"

The Guru said, "When did I say that? Who would die? I just said… 'will die.' I never said that *he* would die.

Hello? The animosity inside you will die. The negativity inside you will die. That's what I said. And it happened, didn't it?"

"Oh, Gurudev, I thought you meant..."

So, remember this: understanding a Guru is a bit... it's a bit tough, a bit different. They say one thing but intend to convey something else entirely. Whenever a Guru tells you something, understand that what they are saying isn't the literal meaning; they are conveying something else entirely.

But what we do is we cling to the literal words. A Guru's intention is something else entirely. But what happened in the end? It died, didn't it? What died? The negativity, animosity, and ill will inside him died, didn't it? That's all.

Thank you so much, Gurudev.

Yes.
