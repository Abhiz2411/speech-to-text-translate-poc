Gurudev, can memory also be deleted through these three spiritual practices?
Yes.
It seems to me
that the mind's supply is for the present. And that memory is of the past.
As we slow down the mind,
its connection with the present moment and with memory
also slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly slows down.
It also gets disconnected. And then you don't even remember it. And then that memory slowly, slowly gets lost.
Bad memories.
Good memories are necessary, but the loss of bad memories is also necessary.
Gurudev, we make good memories, but bad memories are very few, yet only those come to mind.
Yes. Yes.
Because bad memories are deep.
And good memories are superficial.
The ones that are deep, they keep coming out again and again and again.
So what should we do?
Whatever caused the bad memories,
make that same thing the reason for good memories.
There was a person
who had a lot of trouble with another individual. With their nature, with their behavior, they had a lot of trouble.
They came to a Guru like me.
And asked, "Gurudev, when I see him, I get very negative feelings, when I see him, I feel a lot of hatred."
"What should I do, Sir?"
The Guru closed his eyes, then opened them and said,
"He will die in six months."
He thought, "Oh, he's going to die in six months?"
He heard that and left.
Now whenever he got angry, he'd think, "Oh, that poor fellow is going to die in six months. Let it go, it's better if he's well." "He's going to die in six months," it kept repeating in his mind again and again and again.
Now he started feeling goodwill towards that person. Feelings of compassion began to arise within him.
What happened?
When the six months were about to be complete, what happened?
Attention (or Care).
When the six months were about to be complete, he had developed so much goodwill towards him that he cared for him, he went to him, if he needed something, he would give it to him. He kept repeating, "He will die now, he will die now, he will die now..."
Now, with two or three days left in the six months, he thought, "No, let's go to Gurudev once." He went back to the Guru.
Gurudev,
you said that man would die. Only two or three days are left for the six months to be over. He's going to die. Please do something!
What? He didn't die? That's good. What is he? He's good.
The Guru said, "Where did I say that?"
The Guru said, "Where did I say that? Who will die?"
I just said... What did I say? He will die. Where did I say that *he* would die?
Hello!
The hatred within *you* will die. The negativity within *you* will die. That's what I said.
It happened, didn't it?
Oh, Gurudev, I thought you...
So remember, understanding a Guru is a bit, a bit tough, a bit different, a bit... they say something and mean something entirely different. Whenever a Guru tells you something, understand that what they are saying isn't the direct meaning; they mean something else entirely.
But what we do is, we cling to the words.
What the Guru means is something entirely different.
But what happened in the end? Something died, didn't it? What died? The negativity, the hatred, the ill-will inside him died, didn't it? That's it.
Thank you so much, Gurudev.
Yes.
