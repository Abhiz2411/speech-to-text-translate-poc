Gurudev, will memory also be deleted in this way, through these three practices?
Yes. I feel that...
...the mind's supply, is for the present (what's in front of you) and here is the memory of the past.
As we slow down the mind, the mind's connectivity with its objects (or causes) and with memory, that also slowly, slowly, slowly slows down. That also gets disconnected. And then you don't even remember it, and then that memory slowly gets lost.
Bad memories.
Good memories are necessary, but it's also necessary for bad memories to be lost.
Gurudev, we make good memories, but bad memories are very few, yet only those come to mind.
Yes, yes. Because bad memories are deep. And good memories are superficial. What is deep, keeps coming out again and again and again. So what should we do? The very thing that causes bad memories, make that the reason for good memories.

For a certain person, for a certain individual, there was a lot of suffering. With his nature, with his behavior, there was a lot of suffering. He came to a Guru like me and asked, "Gurudev, when I see him, I get very negative feelings, seeing him fills me with a lot of hatred. What should I do, Gurudev?"
The Guru closed his eyes, then the Guru opened his eyes and said, "He will die in six months."
He thought, "Oh, he's going to die in six months?" He heard that and left.
Now, whenever he used to get angry at him, [he'd think] "Oh, that poor fellow is going to die in six months. Let it be, it's good if he's well." "He's going to die in six months," this kept repeating in his mind again and again and again. Now he started feeling goodwill towards him. Feelings of affection started to arise within him for that person. What happened?
When the six months were about to be over, then what happened?
(Student: Attention...)
The six months were about to be over, right? So much goodwill had arisen in him towards that person, he used to care for him, go to him, give him whatever he needed, repeatedly [thinking], "Now he will die, now he will die..."
And also... now when only two or three days were left of the six months, he thought, "No, let's go to Gurudev once." He came back to the Guru.
"Gurudev, you said that man... only two or three days are left for the six months to be over, he will die. Please do something."
"What? He won't die, he's fine."
"What is he? He's fine."
The Guru said, "Where did I say that?"
The Guru said, "Where did I say who would die? I said, 'He will die.' What did I say? 'He will die.' Where did I say that 'he' (referring to the other person) would die? Hello... The hatred within you will die, the negativity within you will die, that's what I said."
It happened, didn't it?
"Oh Gurudev, I was just..."
So remember what? Understanding a Guru is a bit... a bit tough, a bit different, a bit... something they say one thing, but they mean something else entirely. Whenever a Guru tells you something, understand that what they are saying isn't what it seems, they are saying something else entirely. But we, what do we do? We catch onto the words. The Guru's true meaning is something else. But what happened? In the end, it died, didn't it? What died? The negativity, hatred, ill-will within him died, didn't it? That's all.
Thank you so much Gurudev.
Yes.
