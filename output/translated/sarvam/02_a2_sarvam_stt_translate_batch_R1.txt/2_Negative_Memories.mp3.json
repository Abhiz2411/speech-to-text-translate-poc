I feel that the mind, the supply of the mind, is either due to the present or it is the memory of the past. As we slow down the mind, The connectivity with the mind's instruments and memory, that also slowly, slowly, slowly slows down. That also gets disconnected, and then you don't even remember it, and then that memory slowly gets lost. Bad memories. Good memories are necessary, but it is also necessary to have a loss of bad memories.\nGood memories do, bad memories are very few, yet it is easy to remember.\nYes, yes.\nBecause bad memories are deep.\nAnd good memories are on the surface. It's deep, it's coming out again and again. So what should we do? Make the reason for bad memories the reason for good memories. A person was very troubled by a particular individual. They were very troubled by their nature and their behavior. He came to a guru like me. And asked him, Gurudev, I get very negative feelings when I see him, I get a lot of hatred when I see him. What should I do with him? The guru closed his eyes, the guru opened his eyes and said, He will die in six months. He thought, oh, he is going to die in six months. He heard it and left. Now whenever he got angry, he would say, \"Oh, that poor fellow is going to die in six months. Let it go, it's good if it's good for him.\" He is going to die in six months. Again and again and again and again and again, it kept running in his mind. Now, goodwill started towards him. He started feeling emotion within himself towards him. What happened? What happened when six months were about to be completed? When six months were about to be completed, he had so much goodwill towards her, he cared for her, he went to her, he would give her something, he would come again and again, he will die now, he will die now, even his now. There were two or three days left, right? After that, I thought, let's go to Gurudev once. Let's go back to the Guru. Gurudev. You said Where was that man? He will die in just two-three days after six months are completed. Do something. What? He didn't die, he is good. What is he? He is good. The guru said, where did I say that? The guru said, where did I say that? Who will die? I had said that he will die. What did I say? He will die. Hello. The hatred within you will die, the negativity within you will die. I had said this. It's done, right? Oh Gurudev, I was just telling you... What to remember is that understanding a guru is a bit tough, a bit different, a bit something, they say something and want to say something else. Whenever a guru says something to you, understand that what they are saying is not what they are saying, they are saying something else. But what we do is, we read the words.\nThe Guru's saying is something different, but what happened in the end, he died, right? What died inside him?\nNegative hatred, malice died, right? That's all.","language_code":"hi-IN","diarized_transcript":null}
